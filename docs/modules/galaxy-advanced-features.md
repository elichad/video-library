          Scientific analyses often consist of a number of tools that
          run one after the other, in order to go from the raw data to
          scientific insight. Between these specialized tools, simple
          data manipulation steps are often needed as a kind of “glue”
          between tools.

          Galaxy has a large collection of tools to perform such basic
          data manipulation tasks, and becoming familiar with these
          operations will allow to perform your analysis more easily in
          Galaxy.
