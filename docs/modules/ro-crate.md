[RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate) is a community effort to practically achieve FAIR packaging of [research objects](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2015.01.003) (digital objects like data, methods, software) with structured metadata. RO-Crate uses well-established Web standards and FAIR principles.


For its metadata representations, RO-Crate builds on [schema.org](https://schema.org/), a mature vocabulary understood by search engines including Google Dataset Search. RO-Crate is adopted by many EU/EOSC projects as a pragmatic implementation of the FAIR Digital Objects vision.


Galaxy has recently added RO-Crate support as a way to preserve a workflow and its execution history. RO-Crate is also used to deposit Galaxy workflows in the [WorkflowHub registry](https://workflowhub.eu/) from resources such as the [Intergalactic Workflow Commission](https://github.com/galaxyproject/iwc/).


In this module you will learn about RO-Crate as a concept and technology for FAIR data packaging, with hands-on exercises for making and publishing a crate manually, programmatically, and using Galaxy.


Additional sessions will teach how to capture provenance of any workflow execution, how to follow best practices for publishing Galaxy workflows in WorkflowHub, and how to submit workflows to the [LifeMonitor](https://www.lifemonitor.eu/) testing framework.


This module is created in collaboration with [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/), [BY-COVID](https://by-covid.eu/), [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu/), [FAIR-IMPACT](https://fair-impact.eu/) and [EuroScienceGateway](http://eurosciencegateway.eu/).
