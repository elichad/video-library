visualisation/jbrowse/slides:
  description: JBrowse is a popular Genome Browser. It can be used directly within
    Galaxy. You may have seen it in our Mapping tutorial on Day 1. This tutorial will
    go into more depth about JBrowse and how to use it to explore your genome.

computational-chemistry/cheminformatics/tutorial:
  description: 'Cheminformatics is the use of computational techniques and information
    about molecules to solve problems in chemistry. This involves a number of steps:
    retrieving data on chemical compounds, sorting data for properties which are of
    interest, and extracting new information. This tutorial will provide a brief overview
    of all of these, centered around protein-ligand docking, a molecular modelling
    technique.'

computational-chemistry/md-simulation-gromacs/tutorial:
  description: "Molecular dynamics (MD) is a method to simulate molecular motion by\
    \ iterative application of Newton\u2019s laws of motion. It is often applied to\
    \ large biomolecules such as proteins or nucleic acids. This is a introductory\
    \ guide to using GROMACS (Abraham et al. 2015) in Galaxy to prepare and perform\
    \ molecular dynamics on a small protein. For the tutorial, we will perform our\
    \ simulations on hen egg white lysozyme."

ecology/PAMPA-toolsuite-tutorial/tutorial:
  description: This tutorial aims to present the PAMPA Galaxy workflow, how to use
    it to compute common biodiversity metrics from species abundance data and analyse
    it through generalized linear (mixed) models (GLM and GLMM). This workflow made
    up of 5 tools will allow you to process temporal series data that include at least
    year, location and species sampled along with abundance value and, finally, generate
    article-ready data products.

proteomics/biomarker_selection/tutorial:
  description: A biomarker is a measurable biological component that can be routinely
    detected in clinical practice and reflects a disease state, response to therapeutic
    treatment, or other relevant biological state. In this tutorial we introduce successively
    the tools of this pipeline, and guide you to execute them in order to complete
    the entire pipeline on a concrete example.
